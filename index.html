            <h2>ABOUT THIS SITE</h2>
            <p>
                To build a solid foundation of the fundementals of web development, I developed this site using the
                vanilla technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is also done to minimize maintenance and maximize
                compatibility. I also focused on making the website quick and responsive by containing as much
                information as possible in one page.
                <br><br>
                As you can likely tell, the look of this site was inspired by old electronics from the 80s onwards.
                <br><br>
                This website is currently under development and will be added to over time as more projects become
                complete.

            <p>
                During my time at <a href="https://hide.cs.mtu.edu/">HIDE</a>, I worked as a back-end developer on a
                website designed to streamline the process of using machine shop located in the Minerals and Materials
                Engineering Building for engineering students and staff alike.
                <br><br>
                The project largely used the Python back-end Flask and used a SQLite database. I joined the project
                partway through and took over the work of a student who had left the enterprise, so I dealt with a lot
                of legacy code. My work included the development of the admin dashboard for staff, connecting front-end
                forms to communicate with the database on the back-end, and working with Google's authentication service
                to allow students to use their school account.

            <p>
                Developed using Unity, Wild West Waltz is a 2-player rhythm game about dueling cowboys who can only act
                when "draw" is called by the metronome (or on other beats to reward good timing). What exists now is
                ultimately just a prototype that I might return to one day. I began this game after I launched Squigley
                and started with the objective of having more readable, reusable, and overall better code.

                Macro King is a nutrition and fitness tracking app that was developed by me and five others for my

                team members were familiar with it, but in hindsight I wish we used Android Studio or something more
                focused on developing UI for mobile. Many members weren't familiar with C#, so I was often the acting
                lead and trying to catch people up to speed.
                <br><br>
                To collaborate, we used GitHub and Jira. We also utilized Scrum methodologies throughout the project.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Squigley is a platforming game where you explore a massive 2D world, overcoming difficult obstacles
                using unique movement
                mechanics. The game was launched on Steam in August of 2024 after a year in development.
            </p>
            <h2>Developing Squigley</h2>
            <h3><i>Technologies used: C#, Unity</i></h3>
            <p>
                I've developed Squigley during my first year in college. It started out as a very simple
                project to tinker around with Unity. It uses C#, which is a very similar language to Java, which I was
                currently taking
                and intro class for. As I was just learning how to program, there's a lot of atrocities in this
                codebase. Look closely
                at the GitHub repo and you can probably spot a good few flaws. I got better at programming as the
                project went on, but
                making the game taught me many pitfalls to avoid through firsthand experience.
                <br><br>
                Though I didn't have much experience with video game art and music at the time, I created all of the art
                and most of the
                music on my own. The only exception to this was the "true-ending" credits song "Cattails", which I
                recorded with some of
                my high school friends that I was in a band with. I did this because I wanted the game to have a
                cohesive art-style.
                Though it was all very ametuer, I was happy with the result.
                <br><br>
                After launch, the game recieved a few updates to address user feedback and bug fixes. The game was
                obviously not a huge
                success, but I wanted to make it as complete and as good as possible. The game went free-to-play in
                January of 2025.

            <p>Shorty Shooters is an online multiplayer 2-Dimensional shooter game. The objective is to get the
                most kills by staying in the ring and shooting your opponent while they're vulnerable. Where the game
                shines is its unique movement mechanics, where you can use the gun's recoil in order to launch yourself
                further.
            </p>
            <h2>Developing Shorty Shooters</h2>
            <h3><i>Technologies Used: Godot, GDScript</i></h3>
            <p>
                Shorty Shooters was developed as a part of <a href="https://huskygames.com/">Husky Game Development</a>,
                an organization at Michigan Technological University. The project took place over the course of one
                semester, as many of the six group members didn't have space in their schedules to continue with the
                project. I contributed mostly to programming the core gameplay loop and refining basic features like
                movement and shooting, while also doing some of the environmental art and character spritework. In this
                project, you can see the progress I've made in programming, game design, and pixel art since Squigley.
                <br><br>
                Our team developed Shorty Shooters while using agile methodologies and would document the process of
                development every two-week sprint.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Some updates have been made since the end of the semester the game was created, but all team members
                have moved on to work on other projects. You can download the game for free on <a
                    href="https://huskygamedev.itch.io/shorty-shooters">itch.io</a> if you'd like to try it out.

            <h1>About Jakob "Jay" Hawkins</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a computer science student at Michigan Technological University expecting to graduate in
                2027. I was born in Ann Arbor, MI and grew up in the area until I graduated high school in 2023.
                As of writing this, I have an internship lined up for Summer 2025, but I am always looking for new
                opportunities, so get in touch!
                <br><br>
                Some other things about me: I've played bass and guitar for a while and was a part of two rock bands and
                I occasionally record some music. I also enjoy weight lifting and skateboarding and have also been
                getting into snowboarding this past winter.
