            <p>Shorty Shooters is a multiplayer 2-Dimensional shooter game. The objective is to get the
                most
                kills by staying in the ring and shooting your opponent while they're vulnerable. Where the game shines
                is
                its unique movement mechanics, where you can use the gun's recoil in order to launch yourself further.

            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>A/D: Move Left/Right<br>Space: Jump<br>W/S: Crouch / Look Up<br>Use the mouse to aim<br>Left Click:
                Shoot<br>Right Click: Alt-Fire (Aim down sights)<br>ESC: Pause<br>Tab: View player names
            </p>
            <h3>Connecting</h3>
            <p>Hosting: In order to host a game, press the "Host" button on the main menu. Here, you can choose a port
                and a
                password. It is recommended to leave the port number the same, and passwords can be left empty if one is
                not
                desired. Once you have begun hosting, you will have control over the game settings and have the ability
                to
                kick players (Godot icon by their name). In order for players to be able to join, give them the IP
                address
                found in the top left corner of your screen.
            </p>
            <p>Joining: After pressing the join button on the main menu, you will need to enter the IP address provided
                by
                your host. The port number is likely the default, but if it was changed by the host, you will need to
                set it
                to the same number here. Then, enter the password (if there is one) and join the server! You can
                customize
                your username and appearance here while waiting for the host to start the game.
            </p>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>Download the build for your operating system (Windows or Linux) and simply run the executable file
                inside.
